# Bachelor's Degree Project:  ANT WARZ

This is the repository for the [Bachelor's project (TNM094)](https://liu.se/studieinfo/en/kurs/tnm094/vt-2019), MSc in Media Technology and Engineering, at Linköping University.

## The project

Ant Warz is an *Augmented reality* (AR) multiplayer game for mobile devices. Two teams of 3-4 players fight against each other by sending ants towards the opponents' base, while squishing the enemy ants. The team who's ants eat the enemy's sugar cube first, wins the game.

**Watch the trailer** for the game here: [Ant Warz Trailer](https://vimeo.com/345218845)

The game was developed in the game engine [Unity3D](https://unity.com/), together with the AR solution [Vuforia](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/getting-started-with-vuforia-in-unity.html).
